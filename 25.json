There are two options for this, a global and a personal one.\n\n### Global\n\nWith the global options you can enforce the use of the theme for all users as well as unauthenticated visits. Please note that when the theme is enforced for all users it isn't possible for them to disable the theme or choose a different theme.\n\nThere is also an option to let the theme be enabled / disabled based on the theming preferences reported by browser. When the theme is deactivated using this method, Nextcloud will revert to using the default light theme. This setting only sets the default for when the theme is globally enforced and can be overridden by the user.\n\nYou can also choose whether the login page should be themed. Though this only has an effect if the theme is enforced globally, or during the login phase of a user that has the theme enabled.\n\nYou can find the global options here:\n\n```\nSettings > Administration > Theming > Breeze Dark\n```\n\n### Personal\n\nThe personal option allows each user to enable / disable the theme unless it's being enforced by the global options. They can though choose whether the theme should follow the theming choice reported by the browser. This option is also available when the theme is being enforced globally. If the user hasn't set a preference they will follow the global default. You can find the personal option here:\n\n```\nSettings > Personal > Appearance and accessibility > Breeze Dark\n```\n\n### Custom styling\n\nUnder the Theming section in the admin settings you can add your own custom styling to the theme. Only standard CSS can be used. This custom styling will be applied whenever the theme is enabled and only affects the Breeze Dark theme.",

    "description": "[Pico CMS for Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico) combines the power of [**Pico**](http://picocms.org/) and [**Nextcloud**](https://nextcloud.com/) to create simple, secure, shareable and amazingly powerful websites with just a few clicks. Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS - making the web easy.\n\n* Start a blog\n* Share your resume with the world\n* Create a plan for world domination and only share with the right friends\n* Build a knowledge base and let the smart ones among your colleagues help out\n\nInstalling Pico CMS for Nextcloud allows your users to create and manage their own websites. Creating a new page with Pico is no more than creating a simple text file in a users' Nextcloud files. No config is required, no utterly complex management interfaces - just files. It's the perfect match with Nextcloud. Secure Sharing, Collaboration, Access Control - not just for your files, but also your websites, all made possible by Pico CMS for Nextcloud! Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile & Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) app to make easy things stupidly simple. Please note that Nextcloud's built-in Text editor is incompatible with Pico CMS for Nextcloud. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier‚Ä¶\n\nBut that wasn't everything‚Ä¶ Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Pico‚Äôs appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes aren‚Äôt just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know‚Ä¶",

    "description": "# Features\n- üîíüîí Accept Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES - strongest legal value) in PDF or ASICE formats\n- üîí Accept Simple Electronic Signatures (email based signature - simple to sign)\n\nCurrently, this app enables the user to gather a single signature onto an existing file:\n1. Pick a file which you want signed by another person\n2. Select \"Signing\" in the file's dropdown menu\n3. Enter the signer's email address\n4. The signer receives a link on their e-mail\n5. They sign the document\n6. The signed document appears in your Nextcloud instance, next to the original file\n\n# Built on top of eID Easy\nThe app uses [eID Easy](https://eideasy.com) as its signing back-end. eID Easy handles the signing process. Refer to [eID Easy's pricing](https://eideasy.com/pricing/) to see the cost of each signing method.\n\n### Get ‚Ç¨10 to try out eID Easy\nFor limited time only, we're offering ‚Ç¨10 of credit that you can spend to try out all the eID Easy signing services.\n\nWrite to info@eideasy.com to claim this offer.\n\n# Two levels of electronic signatures\n*Qualified Electronic Signature* - the strongest kind of electronic signature. The signer's identity and approval is linked to the file contents and a timestamp by cryptographic means. The signing time and the document's integrity can be verified to ensure that the document has not been tampered with after signing.\n\nWith QES, you can opt to only send the file hashes to eID Easy. This way, the actual content of your files is never exposed to a third party.\n\n*Simple Electronic Signature* - the simplest kind of electronic signature. eID Easy sends a unique link to the signer's e-mail. The signer opens the link, reviews the file and confirms their approval. A visual signature is added to the file. eId Easy adds a cryptographic e-seal to the file, to ensure that it cannot be modified after signing.\n\nWith Simple Electronic Signatures, the contents of your file need to be sent to eID Easy. This provides legal value to the signature, as we can state with certainty that the signer had the opportunity to review the file they were signing.\n\n# Pricing\nSee [https://eideasy.com/pricing](https://eideasy.com/pricing) for pricing information.\n\n# Feedback is welcome\nAre you not seeing your preferred signature card / signing app / other QES method? Are we not quite covering your use case? Let us know at info@eideasy.com\n\n# Documentation\n\n## Set up\n1. Install and enable the \"Electronic Signatures\" app.\n2. In Nextcloud, on the blue top-bar, click on your profile picture.\n3. A dropdown menu opens, click on \"Settings\".\n4. On the left sidebar, click on \"Electronic Signatures\".\n5. Follow the instructions there to configure your eID Easy credentials.\n\n[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/eideasy/nextcloud-electronic-signatures-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)",

    "description": "# EPUB Viewer\nEPUB Viewer is an ebook reader based on pure javascript renderers. It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [EPUB]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nEPUB files are displayed using the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [EPUB]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/devnoname120/epubviewer/blob/master/epubviewer/README.md",

Once your batch has been purchased, it will take a few minutes for other Bee nodes in the Swarm to catch up and register your batch. Allow some time for your batch to propagate in the network before proceeding to the next step. This is indicated by the checkbox \"Usable\".\n- Uploading files to the swarm costs Bzz, so it is necessary to select a Batch as \"Active\". Only 1 batch is allowed to be Active for a given Bee node. Then click \"Save Settings\".\n\n## Usage\n\nFile handling operations involving the Bee node are integrated in the External Storage (\"Files\") section of Nextcloud.\n\nUsing the plugin, the main file operations that are available in Nextcloud are:\n\n- Upload file(s) to a Bee node\n- Download and view files\n- Copy/Move files from any External Storage to a Bee node\n- Copy files from a Bee node to any External Storage\n\n### Settings\n\nAvailable to users with administrative credentials, the external storage accepts configuration options from two places, the normal External Storage settings, which allows a user to configure the basic connection properties of a Bee node.\n\nSince every operation in Swarm costs money, it is important to view how much money is available to the Bee node directly and also provide a convenient way of handling the payment system in Swarm - all managed directly in Nextcloud. This is in a specific section with more advanced configuration for the Bee node, where the following settings can be viewed and edited:\n\n- Configure which Bee node to manage\n- View current status of the Bee node\n- Option to toggle encryption on and off\n- How much BZZ is available to the node\n- Any purchased stamp batches and the remaining balances\n- Have the option to purchase a new batch of stamps\n- Toggle the batch used for uploading files active/inactive\n\n### Using Swarm\n\nOnce setup and configured, the Bee node is ready to use.\n- Navigate to \"Files\" option on the menu -> \"External Storage\" and then the name of the Bee node.\n- You can then upload files just like you normally would in Nextcloud.\n- Once uploaded, it can be viewed internally or downloaded. It can also be copied to another storage.\n- Files from another Nextcloud storage can also be copied/moved to the Bee node.",

    "description": "A browser phone that can be connected to SIP providers via Asterisk or directly. It can be used in conjunction \nwith Asterisk, to benefit from the control, autonomy and advanced PBX features offered by Asterisk, or without \nAsterisk, if connected directly to the SIP provider. For calls to and from regular phone numbers, a SIP provider \nlike Telnyx or Localphone is needed and a real phone number acquired from that SIP provider. If Asterisk is used, \nit's recommended to be Asterisk version 18.0.0 LTS and it has to be installed on a VPS or dedicated server, as \nexplained in the 'Admin documentation' linked on this page. The web server has to be configured to allow access \nto a specific directory and to proxy WebSocket traffic to a specific URL, as explained in the 'Admin documentation'. \nNot all SIP providers allow connections from external Asterisk servers or direct connections from web applications \nthat use SIP over WebSocket, like SIP Trip Phone. Thus, you can connect this application to Telnyx, Localphone, \nTwilio, Flowroute, Vonage, etc. via an Asterisk server, but if you want to connect it directly to the SIP provider, \nfrom the 5 mentioned providers, only Telnyx will work, because the others don't allow direct connections from web \napplications using SIP over WebSocket.\nSIP Trip Phone is based on the ctxSip phone.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üìû SIP Trip Phone allows making and receiving calls to/from any mobile or landline phone at lower rates than with regular phones. It is known that VoIP phone calls are up to 70% cheaper than regular phone calls. International VoIP phone calls can cost even 90% less than regular phone calls.\n\n* üåê You can acquire phone numbers in countries of your choice and make cheap international phone calls to receivers in those countries. When calling you back on those numbers, the receivers will pay as for local calls.\n\n* üÜì If Asterisk is used, you can make free calls over the Internet between extensions configured on the underlying Asterisk server.\n\n* ‚òéÔ∏è  SIP Trip Phone logs recent phone calls and their duration and allows pausing, muting and transferring phone calls.\n\n* üö© Incoming calls are signaled by on-screen notifications.\n\n* üìÉ Once you open SIP Trip Phone, you can use it even if you are logged out of Nextcloud.\n\n* üíª If Asterisk is used, on the underlying Asterisk server you can implement an IVR (Interactive Voice Response or 'voice menu') and many advanced PBX features such as voicemail, queue management, music on hold, number blacklisting, call recording, audio conference calls, etc.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for a phone number. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low per minute prices: if Asterisk is used, you can make calls within the US starting from $0.0050 per minute and receive calls with $0.0075 per minute or less (Telnyx), or $0.0060 per minute for outgoing calls and $0 for incoming calls (Localphone). If SIP Trip Phone is connected directly to Telnyx, you can make and receive phone calls with $0.0020 per minute in the US.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Localphone, Twilio, Flowroute or Vonage.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sip-trip-phone)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

The 'libcurl' PHP library has to be installed on the server. Detailed instructions \non how to configure and use this application can be found on the 'Admin documentation' page.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üöÄ Use one or multiple local phone numbers in countries of your choice, to send and receive SMS/MMS messages with your browser, on any device connected to the Internet.\n\n* üìë Sent and received SMS/MMS messages are stored in the database per sending/receiving user and can be viewed in paginated tables with filters for every column.\n\n* üñºÔ∏è  Up to 10 files of various formats, including jpeg, png and gif, can be sent as MMS messages from MMS enabled phone numbers. Files included in incoming MMS messages are not downloaded automatically. They are stored as URL links to the actual files, so that the receivers can download them only if they trust the senders.\n\n* üìî SMS/MMS messages older than a specified number of days can be deleted in bulk with one click and they are automatically archived in csv files stored in Nextcloud, before being removed from the database. This makes them available for future analysis.\n\n* üíª Sending SMS/MMS messages to thousands of recipients can be achieved by uploading a txt/csv file containing the recipients' phone numbers and the same SMS/MMS is sent automatically to all. The time interval between two consecutive messages is configurable.\n\n* üë§ The Display Name of Nextcloud users can be prepended to their messages, so that the origin of the messages is much clearer.\n\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è  Admins can restrict the use of specific phone numbers to specific groups or users.\n\n* ‚úâÔ∏è  Auto-replies in 'daily mode' and 'vacation mode' can be configured for any controlled phone number.\n\n* üîè SMS/MMS messages coming from Telnyx, Plivo and Twilio are checked for authenticity by verifying the SMS provider's signature.\n\n* üìß Users receive notifications in Nextcloud and (optionally) emails when new SMS/MMS messages arrive.\n\n* üìÑ Each sent message receives a delivery receipt displayed in the Sent SMS Messages table.\n\n* üì± It works with regular 'long code' (10-digit) phone numbers, but also with 'toll-free' numbers and 'short codes'. Users see a list with their current phone numbers and can set them as Sender IDs. Setting alphanumeric Sender IDs is also possible. \n\n* üíµ It allows checking the current Telnyx/Plivo/Twilio balance by selecting the provider on the left panel.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for an SMS/MMS enabled phone number located in a country chosen by the user. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low prices per SMS: starting from $0.0060 per sent message and $0.0040 per received message (Telnyx), or $0.0070 per sent message and $0 per received message (Plivo), or $0.0099 per sent message and 0.0079 per received message (Twilio), or $0.0055 per sent message and 0.0040 per received message (Flowroute) in the USA.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Plivo, Twilio or Flowroute.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sms-relentless)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\n```\nor\n```json\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThere is also support for setting the displayName:\n```\n{\"roles\": [{gid: 1, displayName: \"admin\"}, {gid: 2, displayName: \"user\"}]}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\n## Examples for groups\n\n* You can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff)\n* [GitLab OIDC allowing specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](#configure-discord)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n* PlexTv - you can use any title as app id\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\nTo set options for http client, you can use\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // Check https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html for allowed variants\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`\n\n### Configurate a provider via CLI\n\nYou can configure everything from commandline by using the occ utility. To setup a oidc-provider replace the variables and URLs with values that match your deployment.\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nto do this with docker you just need to add `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` in front of the command, or run it interactively from `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`\n\nTo find out how to configure other providers, just configure them in the GUI and take a look at the database afterwards:\n```\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\n\nOr just run\n\n`docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers`\n\n### Configure Discord\n\nTo properly configure discord you have to:\n\n1. Create new discord application on [DiscordApp developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n2. Open tab `Settings -> OAuth2 -> General`. In `Redirects` add new redirection link looking like this: `https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/discord`.\n3. Copy `CLIENT ID` and generate and copy `CLIENT SECRET`\n4. Open in Nextcloud `Settings -> Social Login` and paste `CLIENT ID` into field `App id` and `CLIENT SECRET` into `Secret`.\n5. Select default group for users created this way.\n6. For group mapping check [#395](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/pull/395)\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', in your config.php file.",

    "description": "# Storj NextCloud App\n\nAdds external storage support for [Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage](https://storj.io) to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)\n\nStorj Community contributed.\n\n* [Docker image](#docker-image)\n* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n    * [Detailed instructions for docker version of Nextcloud](#detailed-instructions-for-docker-version-of-nextcloud)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Configuration](#configuration)\n* [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n    * [Building](#building)\n    * [Publish to App Store](#publish-to-app-store)\n    * [Running tests](#running-tests)\n* [Known issues](#known-issues)\n\n## Docker image\n\nWe supply a ready-to-use Docker image with Nextcloud and Storj pre-installed. \n\n```\ndocker run storjthirdparty/nextcloud-app:23.0.4-apache \\\n    --env OBJECTSTORE_STORJ_ACCESS_GRANT=myaccessgrant \\\n    --env OBJECTSTORE_STORJ_BUCKET=mybucket\n```\n\nMore information at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/storjthirdparty/nextcloud-app)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Linux\n- x86_64 or ARM64\n- libffi installed\n\nThe PHP installation should have the FFI extension loaded and enabled unconditionally in php.ini:\n\n```\nextension=ffi\n\nffi.enable=true\n```\n\nDetailed instructions depend on your distro.\n\n### Detailed instructions for docker version of Nextcloud\n\nBy default the Nextcloud docker image comes without `FFI` support. But you can install it inside the container:\n\n```\ndocker exec -it nextcloud bash\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apt update \nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apt install libffi-dev\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# docker-php-ext-install ffi\n```\n\n(\"nextcloud\" is the name you gave the container earlier)\n\nThe extension is now enabled through `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-ffi.ini`\n\nAlso allow loading libraries at runtime:\n\n```\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# echo ffi.enable=true > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ffi.ini\n```\n\nReload Apache:\n\n```\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apachectl graceful\n```\n\nTo make changes permanent you need to build your own image. Create a `Dockerfile`:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nextcloud\nRUN apt update && apt install -y libffi-dev && docker-php-ext-install ffi\nRUN echo ffi.enable=true > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ffi.ini\n```\n\nAnd build it:\n\n```\ndocker build . -t my/nextcloud\n```\n\nNow you can run your own image, change `docker run ... nextcloud` to `docker run ... my/nextcloud`\n\n## Installation\n\nThis app is published on the [App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/storj).\n\nThere are two ways to install:\n- Install from the App Store GUI of your Nextcloud instance. Tap on your profile (top right) and then \"+ Apps\"\n- Download and extract the tarball in the folder `apps` of your Nextcloud installation\n\n## Configuration\n\nStorj works like any external object storage. See the documentation on docs.nextcloud.com:\n\n* [Configuring External Storage (GUI)](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/24/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage_configuration_gui.html)\n* [Configuring Object Storage as Primary Storage](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/24/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html)\n\nThis is the configuration to set Storj as your primary storage:\n\n```php\n$CONFIG = [\n    'objectstore' => [\n        'class' => \\OCA\\Storj\\StorjObjectStore::class,\n        'arguments' => [\n            'serialized_access' => 'myaccessgrant',\n            'bucket' => 'mynextcloudbucket',\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n```\n\nPrimary storage is more responsive because it relies more on your local database, but does create small files, which is not the best usecase for Storj.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n### Building\n\nThe app can be built by using the provided Makefile by running:\n\n    make\n\n### Publish to App Store\n\nBump the version in [./appinfo/info.xml](./appinfo/info.xml)\n\nBuild un:\n\n    make && make appstore\n\nThe archive is located in build/artifacts/appstore. \nFollow the instructions at [https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/releases/new](http://apps.nextcloud.com/) to upload the app to the store.\n\n### Running tests\n\nYou can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:\n\n    make test\n\nThis will run the PHP unit and integration tests and if a package.json is present in the **js/** folder will execute **npm run test**\n\nOf course you can also install [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/getting-started.html) and use the configurations directly:\n\n    phpunit -c phpunit.xml\n\nor:\n\n    phpunit -c phpunit.integration.xml\n\nfor integration tests\n\n## Known issues\n\n- Enabling Xdebug profiling or debugging will cause a segfault",

This app provides a chat based interface to interact with the Talked server component that handles the actual recording.\n\nCheck out the [Talked server repo](https://github.com/MetaProvide/talked) for more information on how this works and what the current limitations are.\n\n## Installation and setup\n\nIt's available in the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/talked), just search for Talked and you should be able to find it.\n\nOr you can clone this repo into your app folder and enable it in the app menu in Nextcloud.\n\n### Register chat command\n\nTo use the chat command to interact with the Talked server, the command first needs to be registered with Talk. You can register a command using the occ command. The exact command depends on how you have installed Nextcloud. Below I'll have an example for the official docker container and the snap. For more information about registering a chat command, check out the Talk documenation: https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/\n\nYou will find two examples for both the docker container and snap. The only difference is whether you want to allow all registered users in a room to start a recording, or only the moderators.\n\n#### Docker container\n\n##### Only moderators can use\n```\nphp occ talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 1\n```\n##### All registered users can use\n```\nphp occ talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 2\n```\n\n#### Snap\n\n##### Only moderators can use\n```\nocc talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 1\n```\n##### All registered users can use\n```\nocc talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 2\n```\n\n### Configuring Talked\n\nAfter you have registered the Talk command you should configure Talked. If you head to Admin settings > Talk, then you will find the settings for Talked near the bottom. Here you can specify the URI for your Talked server and whether to use HTTP Basic auth, and the credentials for HTTP Basic auth.\n\nThe http / https should be included in the url, for example: https://talked.example.com\n\nYou can also connect to the Talked server over a unix socket. To specify the path to a unix socket prefix the path with `unix:` for example: `unix:/tmp/talked.sock`.\n\nPlease note that abstract sockets aren't supported.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use Talked, simply use the `/recording` command in a chat room. If you don't specify any options or run `/recording help` you will get a help message telling you about the different options. The following options are available:\n\n* `/recording start` - starts a recording in the current room.\n* `/recording stop`  - stops the active recording.\n* `/recording status` - checks if there is an active recording.\n* `/recording info` - prints the version number of the Talked server.\n* `/recording help` - prints a help message with the different options.",
