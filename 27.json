There are two options for this, a global and a personal one.\n\n### Global\n\nWith the global options you can enforce the use of the theme for all users as well as unauthenticated visits. Please note that when the theme is enforced for all users it isn't possible for them to disable the theme or choose a different theme.\n\nThere is also an option to let the theme be enabled / disabled based on the theming preferences reported by browser. When the theme is deactivated using this method, Nextcloud will revert to using the default light theme. This setting only sets the default for when the theme is globally enforced and can be overridden by the user.\n\nYou can also choose whether the login page should be themed. Though this only has an effect if the theme is enforced globally, or during the login phase of a user that has the theme enabled.\n\nYou can find the global options here:\n\n```\nSettings > Administration > Theming > Breeze Dark\n```\n\n### Personal\n\nThe personal option allows each user to enable / disable the theme unless it's being enforced by the global options. They can though choose whether the theme should follow the theming choice reported by the browser. This option is also available when the theme is being enforced globally. If the user hasn't set a preference they will follow the global default. You can find the personal option here:\n\n```\nSettings > Personal > Appearance and accessibility > Breeze Dark\n```\n\n### Custom styling\n\nUnder the Theming section in the admin settings you can add your own custom styling to the theme. Only standard CSS can be used. This custom styling will be applied whenever the theme is enabled and only affects the Breeze Dark theme.",

    "description": "# Nextcloud Cospend üí∞\n\nNextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).\n\nYou can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share expenses with a group of people.\n\nIt lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. Balances are not an absolute amount of money at members disposal but rather a relative information showing if a member has spent more for the group than the group has spent for her/him, independently of exactly who spent money for whom. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be shared with other Nextcloud users or via public links.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).\n\n[PayForMe](https://github.com/mayflower/PayForMe) iOS client is currently under developpement!\n\nThe private and public APIs are documented using [the Nextcloud OpenAPI extractor](https://github.com/nextcloud/openapi-extractor/). This documentation can be accessed directly in Nextcloud. All you need is to install Cospend (>= v1.6.0) and use the [the OCS API Viewer app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocs_api_viewer) to browse the OpenAPI documentation.\n\n## Features\n\n* ‚úé Create/edit/delete projects, members, bills, bill categories, currencies\n* ‚öñ Check member balances\n* üó† Display project statistics\n* ‚ôª Display settlement plan\n* Move bills from one project to another\n* Move bills to trash before actually deleting them\n* Archive old projects before deleting them\n* üéá Automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan\n* üóì Create recurring bills (day/week/month/year)\n* üìä Optionally provide custom amount for each member in new bills\n* üîó Link personal files to bills (picture of physical receipt for example)\n* üë© Public links for people outside Nextcloud (can be password protected)\n* üë´ Share projects with Nextcloud users/groups/circles\n* üñ´ Import/export projects as csv (compatible with csv files from IHateMoney and SplitWise)\n* üîó Generate link/QRCode to easily add projects in MoneyBuster\n* üó≤ Implement Nextcloud notifications and activity stream\n\nThis app usually support the 2 or 3 last major versions of Nextcloud.\n\nThis app is under development.\n\nüåç Help us to translate this app on [Nextcloud-Cospend/MoneyBuster Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/moneybuster).\n\n‚öí Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [User documentation](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/user.md)\n* [Admin documentation](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/admin.md)\n* [Developer documentation](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/dev.md)\n* [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log)\n* [AUTHORS](https://github.com/julien-nc/cospend-nc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors)\n\n## Known issues\n\n* It does not make you rich\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

Pick a file\n2. Select \"Signing\" in the file's dropdown menu\n3. Add signers\n4. Signers receive a link on their e-mail\n5. They sign the document\n6. The signed document appears in your Nextcloud instance, next to the original file\n\n# Built on top of eID Easy\nElectronic signatures app uses [eID Easy](https://eideasy.com) as its signing back-end. eID Easy handles the signing process.

The signer's identity and approval is linked to the file contents and a timestamp by cryptographic means. The signing time and the document's integrity can be verified to ensure that the document has not been tampered with after signing.\n\n**Simple Electronic Signature** - the simplest kind of electronic signature. eID Easy sends a unique link to the signer's e-mail. The signer opens the link, reviews the file and confirms their approval. A visual signature is added to the file. eId Easy adds a cryptographic e-seal to the file, to ensure that it cannot be modified after signing.\n\n# Pricing\nSee [https://eideasy.com/pricing](https://eideasy.com/pricing) for pricing information.\n\n# Feedback is welcome\nAre you not seeing your preferred signature card / signing app / other QES method?

It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [EPUB]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nEPUB files are displayed using the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [EPUB]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/devnoname120/epubviewer#readme",

Once your batch has been purchased, it will take a few minutes for other Bee nodes in the Swarm to catch up and register your batch. Allow some time for your batch to propagate in the network before proceeding to the next step. This is indicated by the checkbox \"Usable\".\n- Uploading files to the swarm costs Bzz, so it is necessary to select a Batch as \"Active\". Only 1 batch is allowed to be Active for a given Bee node. Then click \"Save Settings\".\n\n## Usage\n\nFile handling operations involving the Bee node are integrated in the External Storage (\"Files\") section of Nextcloud.\n\nUsing the plugin, the main file operations that are available in Nextcloud are:\n\n- Upload file(s) to a Bee node\n- Download and view files\n- Copy/Move files from any External Storage to a Bee node\n- Copy files from a Bee node to any External Storage\n\n### Settings\n\nAvailable to users with administrative credentials, the external storage accepts configuration options from two places, the normal External Storage settings, which allows a user to configure the basic connection properties of a Bee node.\n\nSince every operation in Swarm costs money, it is important to view how much money is available to the Bee node directly and also provide a convenient way of handling the payment system in Swarm - all managed directly in Nextcloud. This is in a specific section with more advanced configuration for the Bee node, where the following settings can be viewed and edited:\n\n- Configure which Bee node to manage\n- View current status of the Bee node\n- Option to toggle encryption on and off\n- How much BZZ is available to the node\n- Any purchased stamp batches and the remaining balances\n- Have the option to purchase a new batch of stamps\n- Toggle the batch used for uploading files active/inactive\n\n### Using Swarm\n\nOnce setup and configured, the Bee node is ready to use.\n- Navigate to \"Files\" option on the menu -> \"External Storage\" and then the name of the Bee node.\n- You can then upload files just like you normally would in Nextcloud.\n- Once uploaded, it can be viewed internally or downloaded. It can also be copied to another storage.\n- Files from another Nextcloud storage can also be copied/moved to the Bee node.",

    "description": "# PhoneTrack Nextcloud application\n\nüì± PhoneTrack is a Nextcloud application to track and store mobile device's locations.\n\nüó∫ It receives information from mobile phone's logging apps and displays it dynamically on a map.\n\nüåç Help us to translate this app on [PhoneTrack Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/phonetrack).\n\n‚öí Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nHow to use PhoneTrack :\n\n* Create a tracking session.\n* Give the logging link\\* to the mobile devices. Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n* üìç Display location history\n* ‚õõ Filter points\n* ‚úé Manually edit/add/delete points\n* ‚úé Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n* ‚õ∂ Define geofencing zones for devices\n* ‚öá Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n* üñß Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n* üîó Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n* üñ´ Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n* üó† Display sessions statistics\n* üîí [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n* üóì Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n* ‚óî Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

    "description": "A browser phone that can be connected to SIP providers via Asterisk or directly. It can be used in conjunction \nwith Asterisk, to benefit from the control, autonomy and advanced PBX features offered by Asterisk, or without \nAsterisk, if it's connected directly to the SIP provider. For calls to and from regular phone numbers, a SIP \nprovider like Telnyx or Localphone is needed and a real phone number acquired from that provider. If Asterisk is \nused, it's recommended to be Asterisk version 18.0.0 LTS and it has to be installed on a VPS or dedicated server, \nas explained in the 'Admin documentation' linked on this page. The web server has to be configured to allow access \nto a specific directory and to proxy WebSocket traffic to a specific URL, as explained in the 'Admin documentation'. \nNot all SIP providers allow connections from external Asterisk servers or direct connections from web applications \nthat use SIP over WebSocket, like SIP Trip Phone. Thus, you can connect this application to Telnyx, Localphone, \nTwilio, Flowroute, Vonage, etc. via an Asterisk server, but if you want to connect it directly to the SIP provider, \nfrom the 5 mentioned providers, only Telnyx will work, because the others don't allow direct connections from web \napplications using SIP over WebSocket.\nSIP Trip Phone is based on the ctxSip phone.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üìû SIP Trip Phone allows making and receiving calls to/from any mobile or landline phone at lower rates than with regular phones. It is known that VoIP phone calls are up to 70% cheaper than regular phone calls. International VoIP phone calls can cost even 90% less than regular phone calls.\n\n* üåê You can acquire phone numbers in countries of your choice and make cheap international phone calls to receivers in those countries. When calling you back on those numbers, the receivers will pay as for local calls.\n\n* üÜì If Asterisk is used, you can make free calls over the Internet between extensions configured on the underlying Asterisk server.\n\n* ‚òéÔ∏è SIP Trip Phone logs recent phone calls and their duration and allows holding, muting and transferring phone calls.\n\n* üìë When using Asterisk, SIP Trip Phone allows choosing any available phone number as the 'From' number for outgoing calls.\n\n* üö© Incoming calls are signaled by on-screen notifications.\n\n* üìÉ Once you open SIP Trip Phone, you can use it even if you are logged out of Nextcloud.\n\n* üíª If Asterisk is used, on the underlying Asterisk server you can implement an IVR (Interactive Voice Response or 'voice menu') and many advanced PBX features such as voicemail, queue management, music on hold, number blacklisting, call recording, audio conference calls, etc.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for a phone number. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low per minute prices: if Asterisk is used, you can make calls within the US starting from $0.0050 per minute and receive calls with $0.0075 per minute or less (Telnyx), or $0.0060 per minute for outgoing calls and $0 for incoming calls (Localphone). If SIP Trip Phone is connected directly to Telnyx, you can make and receive phone calls with $0.0020 per minute in the US.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Localphone, Twilio, Flowroute or Vonage.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sip-trip-phone)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

Detailed instructions on how to configure and use this application can be found on the 'Admin documentation' page.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üöÄ Use one or multiple local phone numbers in countries of your choice, to send and receive SMS/MMS messages with your browser, on any device connected to the Internet.\n\n* üìë Sent and received SMS/MMS messages are stored in the database per sending/receiving user and can be viewed in paginated tables with filters for every column.\n\n* üñºÔ∏è  Up to 10 files of various formats, including jpeg, png and gif, can be sent as MMS messages from MMS enabled phone numbers. Files included in incoming MMS messages are not downloaded automatically. They are stored as URL links to the actual files, so that the receivers can download them only if they trust the senders.\n\n* üìî SMS/MMS messages older than a specified number of days can be deleted in bulk with one click and they are automatically archived in csv files stored in Nextcloud, before being removed from the database. This makes them available for future analysis.\n\n* üíª Sending SMS/MMS messages to thousands of recipients can be achieved by uploading a txt/csv file containing the recipients' phone numbers and the same SMS/MMS is sent automatically to all. The time interval between two consecutive messages is configurable.\n\n* üë§ The Display Name of Nextcloud users can be prepended to their messages, to make the origin of messages clearer.\n\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è  Admins can restrict the use of specific phone numbers to specific groups or users.\n\n* ‚úâÔ∏è  Auto-replies in 'daily mode' and 'vacation mode' can be configured for any controlled phone number.\n\n* üîè SMS/MMS messages coming from Telnyx, Plivo and Twilio are checked for authenticity by verifying the SMS provider's signature.\n\n* üìß Users receive notifications in Nextcloud and (optionally) emails when new SMS/MMS messages arrive.\n\n* üìÑ Each sent message receives a delivery receipt displayed in the Sent SMS Messages table.\n\n* üéé Messages exchanged between pairs of numbers are organized into conversations on a separate page where each conversation can be viewed, tagged and archived.\n\n* üìû It can be used with regular 'long code' (10-digit) phone numbers, but also with 'toll-free' numbers and 'short codes'. Users see a list with their current phone numbers and can set them as Sender IDs. Setting alphanumeric Sender IDs is also possible.\n\n* üì± If Nextcloud is accessed in Firefox for mobile (version 123.0 or newer), it can be used directly on mobile devices.\n\n* üíµ It allows checking the current Telnyx/Plivo/Twilio balance by selecting the provider on the left panel.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for an SMS/MMS enabled phone number located in a country chosen by the user. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low prices per SMS: starting from $0.0040 per sent message and $0.0040 per received message (Telnyx), or $0.0085 per sent message and $0.0085 per received message (Plivo), or $0.0109 per sent message and 0.0079 per received message (Twilio), or $0.0055 per sent message and 0.0040 per received message (Flowroute) in the USA.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Plivo, Twilio or Flowroute.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sms-relentless)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

    "description": "# Social login\n\nMake possible create users and login via Telegram, OAuth or OpenID\n\nFor OAuth you must create app for certain providers. Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\n```\nor\n```json\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThere is also support for setting the displayName:\n```\n{\"roles\": [{gid: 1, displayName: \"admin\"}, {gid: 2, displayName: \"user\"}]}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\n## Examples for groups\n\n* You can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff)\n* [GitLab OIDC allowing specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](#configure-discord)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n* PlexTv - you can use any title as app id\n* [Codeberg](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/codeberg.md)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\nTo set options for http client, you can use\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // Check https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html for allowed variants\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`\n\n### Configurate a provider via CLI\n\nYou can configure everything from commandline by using the occ utility. To setup a oidc-provider replace the variables and URLs with values that match your deployment.\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nto do this with docker you just need to add `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` in front of the command, or run it interactively from `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`\n\nTo find out how to configure other providers, just configure them in the GUI and take a look at the database afterwards:\n```\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\n\nOr just run\n\n`docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers`\n\n### Configure Discord\n\nTo properly configure discord you have to:\n\n1. Create new discord application on [DiscordApp developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n2. Open tab `Settings -> OAuth2 -> General`. In `Redirects` add new redirection link looking like this: `https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/apps/sociallogin/oauth/discord`.\n3. Copy `CLIENT ID` and generate and copy `CLIENT SECRET`\n4. Open in Nextcloud `Settings -> Social Login` and paste `CLIENT ID` into field `App id` and `CLIENT SECRET` into `Secret`.\n5. Select default group for users created this way.\n6. For group mapping check [#395](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/pull/395)\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', in your config.php file.",

Features include:\n\n# Adding entries\nWith the integrated timer, you only need to press start and stop! Times will be stored automatically, with 1-second-precision. Forgot to press start? Just use the manual editor, to add entries from the past. Or edit existing ones in case you need to change something!\n\n# Projects, Clients and Tags\nAssign tasks to projects and clients! This allows you to display aggregated durations for each project or client, or filter for tasks by projects or clients. You need some more categorization? That's what tags are made for! Create tags to categorize tasks independently from projects or clients.\n\n# Lost track of your work time?\nNo problem! Just use the Dashboard view to display a nice donut / pie chart of your tasks! Or filter for tasks in the Reports or Timeline view to display total or aggregated values.\n\nThis app is still under development, so stay tuned for updates and additional features! If you have any suggestions, bug reports or feature requests, feel free to head over to our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/mtierltd/timetracker) and search through the existing issues, maybe your topic is already under discussion! And if it's not, feel free to file a new issue for it.\n\nAnd for now, start making your time tracking easier by using this app!",
